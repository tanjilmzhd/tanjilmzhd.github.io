	<h4 class="page-header">Guitar Pedals</h4>
	<p> 
	Are you a guitarist? Do none of the pedals you buy satisfy your appetite for a destructive tone? Or do you want a more mellow sound that the pedal industry doesn't cater to? I can help you. If you tell me what tone you are looking for and find some sample pedals that come close I can help you out. We will work through the product to ensure that you get the tone you wanted.
	</p>

	<p> 
	Have an old guitar that just isn't playing right? Have a new guitar that has been sitting for a while? Or are you planning to buy a guitar and are lost with an ocean of choices. You can ask me for recommendations and appraisals on guitar so you don't pay more than you should. You can also ask me to set up your guitar for you. You will have a difficult time learning the guitar if your guitar is not setup correctly. Bring them to me along with a set of strings and I will set it up for you. I can guide you to decide what strings will work best for you.
