	<h4 class="text-muted">Welcome to my website!</h4>
	<hr>
	<h4 class="page-header">About this website <small class="text-muted"> Why I created this website </small></h4>	
	<p class="lead">  
	I live to make my dreams come true. My goal is to make the most of what I have.
	You can find all the different things I am working on here.
	I hope my work inspires you to do your own.
	Most of the skills that I will present here are self-taught.
	We are a generation with so much connectivity and resources available that I feel guilty if we don't use them to the full extent. So let's go out there and rock the world. Also, what a great way to learn HTML, CSS and JS!
	</p>
    <h4 class="page-header">Why are you here?</h4>
	<p> 
	So what can you expect from this website?
	My interests include engineering, music, photography, cricket, blogs, etc.
	You get the idea.
	How can you use the content? You can use it to motivate yourself. Or you can let me help you by hiring me.
	I will also try to provide you links that you can refer to learn the skills.
	</p>
	<h4 class="page-header">About me: <small class="text-muted"> A mini autobiography </small></h4>
	<p> 
	I descend from the lands of Bangladesh. A mystically beautiful place. There is order amongst the chaos back home. I was born there in 1993 and lived there till 2009 except for a year from mid June, 2005. I went to Beijing, China for that year. Nihao phanghio, wo chung bu dong! I try to speak Chinese still. I do listen and sing some of their songs even today. Since 2009 I have been living within the GTA (greater Toronto Area). I went to Waterloo to study Electrical Engineering (co-op program) and graduated in 2016. I have been working full time since then.
	</p>
	<p> 
	My hobbies have been forever changing. Keeps me on my toes. I grew up being a huge fan of cricket. I still love to watch/play/eat/sleep cricket. My favorite team is of course Bangladesh and then South Africa. I do like soccer but I hardly follow it. I want to get better at playing it though. Then my hobby switched to music. I started singing in 2007 and started writing poems around that time too. I got my first guitar in 2008. I currently have *ahem* a decent collection of guitars. I can play guitar all day. Over the years I really became more of a guitarist but I started singing after graduation again. I also picked up drums as well. I am working towards learning keyboard, violin, saxophone and professional recording now. My favorite genre is progressive rock. My favorite band is Dream Theater. I am currently in three bands and have my solo project running. During university, I picked up photography. It's a skill I have to work on a lot. I use Sony Aplha 55, GoPro Session and my handy dandy Google Pixel for any captures. In 2016 I bought a Mazda 6. I love that car. <i>ZOOM-ZOOM!</i> I love driving (grew up with NFS) and escaping the busy city. Sometimes I take my bike as well and go into a trail. I have also built a gaming PC in 2016 and am mostly always down to play some games. Most of the times I play with my friends! LEAGUE OP! :P After university I really started to miss solving engineering problems. So I am trying to jump start that too. This website is one of them!</p>
